# SandwichPanel_RandomVibration
Simulation of a sandwich panel attached from an imbed ring using 2D meshing using datas from SpaceX Falcon datasheet for the random vibration environment. Used in David Lessard master's.

This is only the latest version of the code (used for the final simulations). The post-processing is not working properly, it still need a fix to be able to retrieve \sigma_{11}, \sigma_{22} and \sigma_{12}. The original repository with all previous versions of the code is found at [https://github.com/davidlessard/Python_Nastran/](https://github.com/davidlessard/Python_Nastran).
